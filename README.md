![Embark on an epic journey](https://github.com/IgorKolodziej/spaceship_titanic/assets/116208286/540d36eb-9142-4793-8c38-d00e7d239b32)

Welcome to my repository for the 
<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic"> Spaceship Titanic </a> Kaggle competition. In this competition, we are given a dataset of passengers who boarded the titanic spaceship, a luxury liner that was supposed to take them on a tour of the galaxy. However, things went horribly wrong when the ship collided with a huge asteroid and some of the passengers were transported to an alternate dimension, where they faced unknown dangers and mysteries. Our task is to predict which passengers survived this ordeal and which ones did not.

This is not your typical Kaggle competition. This is a sci-fi adventure that will test your creativity, your intuition, and your machine learning skills. You will need to explore the data, engineer new features, and build models that can handle the complexity and uncertainty of this scenario. You will also need to communicate your findings and your approach in a clear and engaging way.

Are you ready to join me on this journey? Then clone this repository and follow the instructions in the notebooks. You will find my code, my analysis, and my results for this competition. You will also find some tips and tricks that I learned along the way. I hope you enjoy this project as much as I did. Let's go! ðŸš€

## Project Status

This project is still in progress. There is still plenty of insights hidden in the data that could aid imputation of missing values, and the hyperparameters require more extensive tuning.

## Feedback and Suggestions

I welcome any feedback and suggestions on how to improve this project. You can contact me through my GitHub profile.
